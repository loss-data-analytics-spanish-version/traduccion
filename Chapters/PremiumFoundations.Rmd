## Pricing Principles {#S:PricingPrinciples}

1. Start with expected utility and competitive marketplace.

2. Actuarial Premium Principles

**Section 10.2.1** describes variance and standard deviation principles. Also describes coherent measures. 

3. Actuarial vs Financial Pricing. 

See @bauer2013financial  chapter in *Insurance Economics.*

## Heterogeneous Risks {#S:HeterogeneousRisks}

***
In this section, you learn how to:

- Describe insurance exposures in terms of scale distributions
- Explain an exposure in terms of common types of insurance such as auto and homeowners insurance
- Describe how rating factors can be used to create homogeneous collections of risks
- Measure the impact of a rating factor through relativities

***

```

## Development and Trending {#S:TrendDevelopment}

***
In this section, you learn how to:

- Define and calculate different types of exposure and premium summary measures that appear in financial reports 
- Describe the development of a claim over several payments and link that to various unpaid claim measures, including those incurred but not reported (IBNR) as well as case reserves
- Compare and contrast relative strengths and weaknesses of the pure premium and loss ratio methods for ratemaking

***


```{r child = 'Chapters/PremiumSections/TrendDevelopment.Rmd'}
```

## Selecting a Premium {#S:GiniStatistic}

***
In this section, you learn how to:

- Describe skewed distributions via a Lorenz curve and Gini index
- Define a concentration curve and the corresponding Gini statistic
- Use the concentration curve and Gini statistic for premium selection base on out-of-sample validation

## Other Topics? {#S:Other}

Demand side pricing

Harrington Niehaus include rate regulation

In economics:

- A positive question asks about what is or will be. Examples: How will this law affect the incomes of bankers? How will it affect the number of people who intend to become farmers?
- A normative question asks about what ought to be. Example: Is this law, on balance, a good or bad thing?

Could also include a tad on professionalism...
