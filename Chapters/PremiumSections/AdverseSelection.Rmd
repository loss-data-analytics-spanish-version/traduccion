**The Importance of Charging Equitable Rates**

For a single period, it is important that a company charge premiums that in the aggregate are sufficient to pay claims, expenses and meet profit goals. For a sustainable business in a competitive environment, the company must also price insurance on an equitable basis.

In this context, *equitable* does not mean charging all policyholders the same but instead refers to charging each insured a premium related to expected losses. To illustrate, consider the following example from Werner and Modlin (2010).


**Example: Adverse Selection**

- The average loss ( L ) and LAE ( EL ) is $180. There are no underwriting expenses or profit, so
the average total cost is \$180, and rates are set accordingly.
- The insured population consists of 50,000 high-risk insureds (Level H) and 50,000 low-risk
insureds (Level L).
- The insurance market consists of two companies (Simple Company and Refined Company) that
each currently insure 25,000 of each class of risk.
- H risks have a cost of $230, and L risks have a cost of \$130.
- Simple Company charges H and L risks the same rate, \$180. Refined Company implements a
rating variable to vary the rates according to the cost and, therefore, charges H and L risks $230
and \$130, respectively.
- 1 out of every 10 insureds shops at renewal and bases the purchasing decision on price.

At renewal, 1 out of 10 insureds shops and makes the purchase decision based on price. For the Simple company, all 25,000 H customers renew but 2,250 L customers switch. For the Refined Company,
all 25,000 L customers renew but 2,250 H customers switch. This results in the following distribution at the end of the second policy year:

In this world of no contingencies, the Refined company breaks even for each risk class and thus on an overall basis. In contrast, the Simple company has lost $250,000 in period 2 or may have raised rates by \$5, from $180 to $185, to break even. This cycle will continue, with high risks moving from the refined company to the simple company and low risks moving in the opposite direction. Because Simple company continues to take on high risks and lose low risks, either they lose more and more money every year or charge higher and higher premiums (or both). It sometimes known as a "death spiral".

From the perspective of managers of the Simple company, insureds are displaying *adverse selection* in their choice of insurers.

***


When a company identifies a characteristic that differentiates risk that other companies are not using, the company has two options for making use of this information:

1. Implement a new rating variable.

2. Use the characteristic for purposes outside of ratemaking (e.g., for risk selection, marketing, agency management).

**Example: Motorcycle Insurance.** Originally, motorcycle
insurers used very simple rating algorithms that did not include any variation based on the age of the operator. The first companies that recognized that the age of the operator is an important predictor of risk implemented higher rates for youthful operators. In order to keep their overall premium revenue neutral, they lowered rates for non-youthful operators. By doing this, the companies were able to attract a large portion of the profitable adult risks from their competitors. Furthermore, those youthful operators who
chose to insure with them were written profitably.

***

If allowed by law, the company may continue to charge the average rate but utilize the
characteristic to identify, attract, and select the lower-risk insureds that exist in the insured population;
this is called \emph{skimming the cream.}
